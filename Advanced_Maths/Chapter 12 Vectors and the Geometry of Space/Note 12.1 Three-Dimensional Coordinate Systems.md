# Basic Concepts

- right-handed coordinate frame
- rectangular coordinates(Cartesian coordinates for space)
- coordinate planes 
- octants(generally use the first octant)

# Distance and Spheres in Space

### The Distance Between $P_{1}(x_{1},y_{1},z_{1})$ and $P_{2}(x_{2},y_{2},z_{2})$

$$
|P_{1}P_{2}|=\sqrt{ (x_{2}-x_{1})^{2}+(y_{2}-y_{1})^{2}+(z_{2}-z_{1})^{2} }
$$

### The Standard Equation for the Sphere of Radius $a$ and Center $(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0})$

$$
(x-x_{0})^{2}+(y-y_{0})^{2}+(z-z_{0})^{2}=a^{2}
$$
and we can use the inequalities to judge a point inside or outside a sphere.
