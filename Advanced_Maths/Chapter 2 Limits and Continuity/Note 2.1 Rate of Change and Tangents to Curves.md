## **Average and Instantaneous Speed**

- Average Speed:
	average speed = distance covered / time elapsed
- Instantaneous Speed:
	Time elapse approached zero (limit idea)

## **Average Rates of Change and Secant Lines**

- **Definition:**
	The average rate of change for $y=f(x)$ with respect to $x$ over $[x_{1},x_{2}]$ is $$\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\frac{f(x_{2})-f(x_{1})}{x_{2}-x_{1}}=\frac{f(x_{1}+h)-f(h)}{h},h\neq 0$$
- **Secant lines:**
	A line joining two points of a curve

## **Instantaneous Rates of change and Tangent Lines**

- **Definition:**
	If $\displaystyle \frac{f(x_{1}+h)-f(x_{1})}{h}$ approaches $m_{0}$ **from either side**, then we say the tangent $p$ exists and the slope of the tangent line is $m_{0}$.
