## **Defining Surface Area**

- **Definition**
	If the function $f(x)\geq0$ is continuous and differentiable on $[a,b]$, then the area of the surface generated by revolving the graph $y=f(x)$ about the $x$-axis is $$S=\int_{a}^{b} 2\pi y\sqrt{ 1+\left( \frac{dy}{dx} \right)^{2} } \, dx =\int_{a}^{b} 2\pi f(x)\sqrt{ 1+(f^{\prime}(x))^{2} } \, dx $$
- **Proof**
	For the nonnegative continuous function $y=f(x),a\leq x\leq b$, revolves about the $x$-axis, we partition the closed interval $[a,b]$ in the usual way. Then the sketched surface approximates as a rectangular. For every small rectangular, its weight is $W=\sqrt{ 1+f^{\prime}(c_{k})^{2} }\cdot\Delta x_{k}$ and its length is $L=2\pi f(c_{k})$, where $c_{k}$ satisfies that $\Delta y_{k}=f^{\prime}(c_{k})\Delta x_{k}$. So the area of the small rectangular is $$S_{k}=2\pi f(c_{k})\sqrt{ 1+f^{\prime}(c_{k}) }\Delta x_{k}$$
	So the sum of the area is $$S=\sum_{k=1}^{n} 2\pi f(c_{k})\sqrt{ 1+f^{\prime}(c_{k}) }\Delta x_{k}=\int_{a}^{b} 2\pi f(x)\sqrt{ 1+(f^{\prime}(x))^{2} } \, dx $$

## **Revolution About the $y$-Axis**

- **Surface Area for Revolution About the $y$-Axis**
	If the function $x=g(y)\geq0$ is continuous and differentiable on $[c,d]$, then the area of the surface generated by revolving the graph $x=g(y)$ about the $y$-axis is $$S=\int_{c}^{d} 2\pi x\sqrt{ 1+\left( \frac{dx}{dy} \right)^{2} } \, dy =\int_{c}^{d} 2\pi g(y)\sqrt{ 1+(g^{\prime}(y))^{2} } \, dy $$
