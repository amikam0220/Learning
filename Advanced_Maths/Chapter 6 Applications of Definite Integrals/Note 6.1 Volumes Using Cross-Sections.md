## **Cross-Section**

- **Definition:**
	A cross-section of a solid $S$ is the plane region formed by intersecting $S$ with a plane. And we can use this to obtain the volume of solid.

## **Slicing by Parallel Planes**

- **Definition:**
	The volume of a solid of integrable cross-sectional area $A(x)$ from $x=a$ to $x=b$ is the integral of $A$ from $a$ to $b$, that is, $$V=\int_{a}^{b} A(x) \, dx $$Proof:
		First, we can divide the interval $[a,b]$ into $n$ subintervals by the partition $P=\{x_{0},x_{1},\cdots,x_{n}\}$. Then the $k$th base area is $A(x_{k})$ and the height is $\Delta x_{k}$. So the $k$th volume is $V_{k}=A(x_{k})\Delta x_{k}$. Then the total volume is $$V=\sum_{k=1}^{n} V_{k}=\sum_{k=1}^{n} A(x_{k})\Delta x_{k}$$and it is a Riemann sum for the functions $A(x)$ on $[a,b]$. Then $$\lim_{ n \to \infty } \sum_{k=1}^{n} A(x_{k})\Delta x_{k}=\int_{a}^{b} A(x) \, dx  $$
- **Calculating the Volume of a Solid:**
	- Sketch the solid and a typical cross-section.
	- Find a formula for the area of a typical cross-section.
	- Find the limits of integration.
	- Integrate $A(x)$ to find the volume.

## **Solids of Revolution: The Disk Method**

- **Definition:**
	The solid generated by rotating (or revolving) a plane region about an axis in its plane is called a solid of revolution. 
- **Volume by Disks for Rotation About the $x$-axis or the $y$-axis**
	$$V=\int_{a}^{b} A(x) \, dx =\int_{a}^{b} \pi[R(x)]^{2} \, dx \text{ or }=\int_{c}^{d} \pi[R(y)] \, dy $$
	and this method is called the disk method.

## **Solids of Revolution: The Washer Method**

- **Scene:**
	The region we revolve to generate a solid does not border on or cross the axis of revolution, then the solid will have a hole in it. Then we need to use the washer's area.
- **Definition:**
	volume by washers for rotation about the $x$-axis $$V=\int_{a}^{b} A(x) \, dx =\int_{a}^{b} \pi([R(x)]^{2}-[r(x)]^{2}) \, dx $$where $R(x)$ is outer radius and $r(x)$ is inner radius.
