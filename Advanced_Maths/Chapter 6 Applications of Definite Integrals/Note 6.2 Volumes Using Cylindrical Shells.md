## **Slicing with Cylinders**

- **Strategy:**
	We can slice with cylinders straight down through the solid so that the axis of each cylinder is parallel to the $y$-axis. Then unroll each cylindrical shell, whose volume is the product of the area $A(x)$ of the rectangular slab and the thickness $\Delta x$.
- **Example:**
	![[FigureOfSlicingWithCylinders1.png]]For this example, it is awkward to use the washer method since we need to express the $x$-value in terms of $y$ and its formula is complicated. So we can slice the solid into cylindrical shell.
	![[FigureOfSlicingWithCylinders2.png]]
	then each slice is setting over a subinterval of $x$-axis of width $\Delta x_{k}$ so that the thickness of the cylindrical shell is $\Delta x_{k}$. And its radius is $1+x_{k}$ so that the length of it is $2\pi(1+x_{k})$. Then the height is $y(x_{k})=3x_{k}-x_{k}^{2}$.
	![[FigureOfSlicingWithCylinders3.png]] Then the volume of every cylindrical shell is $$\Delta V_{k}=2\pi(1+x_{k})\cdot(3x_{k}-x_{k}^{2})\cdot\Delta x_{k}$$So the sum of individual shells gives the Riemann sum $$\sum_{k=1}^{n} \Delta V_{k}=\sum_{k=1}^{n} 2\pi(1+x_{k})\cdot(3x_{k}-x_{k}^{2})\cdot\Delta x_{k}$$When $n\to \infty,||P||\to0$, that is, $\Delta x_{k}\to 0$, $$V=\lim_{ n \to \infty }\sum_{k=1}^{n} 2\pi(1+x_{k})\cdot(3x_{k}-x_{k}^{2})\cdot\Delta x_{k}=\int_{0}^{3} 2\pi(x+1)(3x-x^{2}) \, dx  $$

## **The Shell Method**

- **Shell Formula for Revolution About a Vertical Line**
	The volume of the solid generated by revolving the region between the $x$-axis and the graph of a continuous function $y=f(x)\geq0,L\leq a\leq x\leq b$, about a vertical line $x=L$ is $$V=\int_{a}^{b} 2\pi(x-L)f(x) \, dx $$
