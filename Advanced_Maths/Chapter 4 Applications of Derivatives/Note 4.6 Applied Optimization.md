## **Strategy:**

- Decide precisely what we want to maximize or minimize, then assign names to all variables.
- Express the relationship between variables in terms of equations or inequalities(graph it if necessary).
- Express the quantity to be optimized in terms of just one variable.
- Find $f^{\prime}(x)$ and find the required optimization.
- Interpret your results in terms of appropriate quantities.
