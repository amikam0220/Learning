## **Functions; Domain and Range**

- **Definition of function:** 
	A function $f$ is a corresponding relationship that for any element $x \in D$ there will be a unique element $f(x)\in R$ to $x$.
- **Domain ( denoted by $D$ or $D(f)$ )**
	- Natural Domain: the domain that makes functions meaningful.
	- Notation: Set notation ($\{x|x>1\}$), Interval notation ($(1,+\infty)$).
- **Range ( denoted by $R$ or $R(f)$ )**
- Rules to judge whether two functions are the same:
	same domain and the same rule.

## **The Vertical Line Test For a Function**

- No vertical line can intersect the graph of a function more than once.
## **Odd and Even Functions**

- Geometrical Properties
- Arithmetic of these functions
- Property: If $f(x)=0$ and $af(x)+bf\left( \frac{1}{x} \right)=\frac{c}{x},x\neq0;a,b,c\text{ are constants};|a|=|b|$, then $f(x)$ is an odd function.

## **Monotonicity of a function** 

- Increasing and decreasing.

## **Other Types of functions**
- Piecewise-Defined Functions: 
	- Absolute value function: $f(x)=|x|$
	- Greatest Integer Function(integer floor function) ($f(x)=\lfloor x  \rfloor$)
	- Least Integer Function(integer ceiling function) ($f(x)=\lceil x \rceil$)
- constant function: $f(x)=c$ 
- Dirichlet Function: $f(x)=\begin{cases}1,x\text{ is rational numbers.} \\ 0,x\text{ is not rational.}\end{cases}$
- Linear Function: $f(x)=kx+b$, Proportional: $y=kx$
- Power Function: $f(x)=x^a$
- exponential and logarithmic functions: ( $f(x)=e^x,f(x)=\ln x$) 
- polynomials
- rational function: quotient of two polynomials. If the degree of numerator is higher than denominator's, it is improper rational functions. Otherwise it is proper rational functions. Generally, we can split a improper rational function into the sum of a polynomial and a proper rational function. ^a6a488
