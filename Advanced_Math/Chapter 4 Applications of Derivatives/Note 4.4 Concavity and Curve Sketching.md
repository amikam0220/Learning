## **Concavity**

- **Definition:**
	If the function $f(x)$ is differentiable on $(a,b)$ then the graph of $f$ is concave upward(downward) on $(a,b)$ if $f^{\prime}$ is increasing(decreasing).
- **The Second Derivative Test For Concavity:**
	Let $y=f(x)$ is twice-differentiable on $I$, then the function $f$ is concave upward(downward) when $f^{\prime\prime}(x)>0(f^{\prime\prime}(x)<0)$ on $I$.
- **The Procedure of Finding Concave Intervals**
	- Finding the points where $f^{\prime\prime}(x)=0$ or $f^{\prime\prime}(x)$ doesn't exist.
	- Make the sign table with intervals, $f^{\prime}(x),f^{\prime\prime}(x)$($CU(\cup),CD(\cap)$)
	- Write the answer.

## **Points of Inflection**

- **Definition:**
	A point where the graph of a function has a tangent line and the concavity changes. At such a point, $f^{\prime\prime}(c)=0$ or $f^{\prime\prime}(x)$ doesn't exist.

## **Second Derivative Test for Local Extrema**

- **Theorem 5--Second Derivative Test for local Extrema:**
	Suppose $f^{\prime\prime}$ is continuous on an open interval that contains $x=c$ and $f^{\prime}(c)=0$.
	- If $f^{\prime\prime}(c)>0(f^{\prime\prime}(c)<0)$, then $f$ exists a local minimum(maximum) at $x=c$.
	- If $f^{\prime\prime}(c)=0$ or doesn't exist, the test is inconclusive.
- **Procedure for Graphing $y=f(x)$**
	- Find the intercepts of $f(x)$: Solve $f(x)=0$ for $x$ and substitution $x=0$ to get the $x$ intercept(s) and the $y$ intercept.
	- Find $f^{\prime}(x),f^{\prime\prime}(x)$: Solve $f^{\prime}(x)=0,f^{\prime\prime}(x)=0$ for $x$.
	- Make a sign table with interval, $f(x),f^{\prime}(x),f^{\prime\prime}(x)$.
	- Sketch the graph of $f$.
- **Guidelines For Sketching a Curve:**
	- Domain
	- Intercepts
	- Symmetry
	- Asymptotes
	- Intervals of Increase and decrease
	- Concavity and points of inflection
	- Sketch the curve
- **Strategy for graphing a rational function:**
	- Domain
	- Intercepts
	- Vertical and horizontal asymptotes
	- Find $f^{\prime}(x),f^{\prime\prime}(x)$ and where $f^{\prime}(x),f^{\prime\prime}(x)=0$ or don't exist.
