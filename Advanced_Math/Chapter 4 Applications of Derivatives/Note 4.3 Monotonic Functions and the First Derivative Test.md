## **Increasing and Decreasing Functions**

- **Definition:**
	Suppose that $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$, if $f^{\prime}(x)>0(f^{\prime}(x)<0)$ at each point $x\in(a,b)$, then $f$ is increasing (decreasing) on $[a,b]$.
- **The Procedure of Finding Monotone Intervals**
	- Find the point where $f^{\prime}(c)=0$ or $f^{\prime}(x)$ doesn't exist.(critical points)
	- Make a sign table
	- From the table determine the monotone interval and relative extrema directly.

## **First Derivative Test for Local Extrema**

- If $f^{\prime}$ changes from negative(positive) to positive(negative) at $c$, then $f^{\prime}$ has a local minimum(maximum) at $c$.
- If $f^{\prime}$ doesn't change sign at $c$, no local extremum at $c$.
