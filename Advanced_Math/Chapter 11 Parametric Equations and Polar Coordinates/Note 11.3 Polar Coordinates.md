# Definition of Polar Coordinates
### Definition

To define polar coordinates, we first fix an ==origin== $O$ (called the ==pole==) and an ==initial ray== from $O$. Then each point $P$ can be located by assigning to it a ==polar coordinate pair== $(r,\theta)$ in which $r$ gives the directed distance from $O$ to $P$ and $\theta$ gives the directed angle from the initial ray to ray $OP$.

### Remarks

The polar coordinates are not unique. The $\theta$ depends on measuring by counterclockwise or clockwise(positive) and the $r$ can be negative when measuring it by the ==going backward== after deciding $\theta$.

### Example

For the polar coordinates of the point $P(2,\pi/6)$, it can be be represented as $$\left( 2, \frac{\pi}{6}+2n\pi \right),n\in \mathbf{Z}$$ and $$\left( -2, -\frac{5}{6}\pi+2n\pi \right),n\in \mathbf{Z}$$

| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| $r=a$               | Circle of radius $\|a\|$ centered at $O$                           |
| $\theta=\theta_{0}$ | Line through $O$ making an angle $\theta_{0}$ with the initial ray |
