## **Introduction**

- This section introduces some important applications to mathematics, computer science and other disciplines.

## **Translating English Sentences**

- **Applications:**
	- Remove the ambiguity in natural languages
	- Convenient to analyze and infer.
- **Strategy:**
	Transform the sentence into proposition logic.
## **System Specifications**

- **Application:**
	- Produce precise specification to be used as the basis for system development.
	- Ensure the system specification be consistent.(A list of propositions is consistent if it is possible to assign truth values to the proposition variables so that each proposition is true)

## **Boolean Searches**

- **Definition:**
	The searches employing the techniques from propositional logic.

## **Logic Puzzles**

- **Definition:**
	- The puzzles can be solved using logical reasoning.

## **Logic Circuits**

- **Definition:**
	A logic circuit (or digital circuit) receives input signal each a bit and produces output signals each a bit(0 or 1). Gates is the basic circuits in the circuit.
- **Category of Gate:**
	- Inverter(not gate): take the input $p$ and produce as output $\neg p$.
	- OR gate: take the inputs $p$ and $q$ and produce as output $p\lor q$.
	- AND gate: take the inputs $p$ and $q$ and produce as output $p\wedge q$.
